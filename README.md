This github repository contains the data files and analysis code used in **"Multi-omic machine learning predictor of breast cancer therapy response"** published in _Nature_: 

Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04278-5

The files are organised into three folders:

* _data_: which contains all the genomic and transcriptomic data required to perform the analyses described in the paper
* _R_: contains the R code to reproduce all  analyses
* _resources_: contains additional databases (eg gene lists) which are required by the R scripts.


The predictor machine learning code is currently hosted at: https://github.com/micrisor/NAT-ML
