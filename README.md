This github repository contains the data files and analysis code used in **"Multi-omic machine learning predictor of breast cancer therapy response"**, which is currently under peer-review.

The files are compressed into one ZIP file, and organised into three folders:
* _data_: contains all the genomic and transcriptomic data required to perform the analyses described in the paper
* _R_: contains the R code to reproduce all  analyses
* _resources_: contains additional databases (eg gene lists) which are required by the R scripts.
 
While the article is being peer-reviewed, the contents of the ZIP file have been encrypted and password protected. The password to the repository is the concatenation of the fifth and seventh words in the abstract, without any separator.
 
The ML code is currently hosted at: https://github.com/micrisor/NAT-ML
